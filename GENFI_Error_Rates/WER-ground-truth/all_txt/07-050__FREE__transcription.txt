 We don't do vacations anymore. The last time we went on was to Vegas. There were six of us. It was a great time, super hot. We didn't win anything, so unfortunately we're still working and not retired yet. We got to see all the sites, did the Hoover Dam, we did the Grand Canyon, which was fantastic. It was my husband and I's first vacation together, the whole time we've been together, so it was pretty exciting. Flights were good. I'm a travel princess, so I didn't plan any of it. It was fantastic.
