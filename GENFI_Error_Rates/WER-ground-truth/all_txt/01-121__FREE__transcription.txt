 Okay, so recently went up to the Lake District with my sister and her boyfriend. We were staying just outside the Lake District. We were there for about five days. We did various activities. First day we just visited a place called Arnside, went for a walk around there. Went to Morecambe as well. We did some mountain biking at a place called Windlatter Pass, which is the first time I've been mountain biking before. So it was an interesting experience because there's lots of ups and downs, so it's quite a bit of a struggle. Especially as the same day subsequent to this, we then walked up one of the hills, although given the size, it's quite a bit of a mountain. We did that on the same day, so it was actually a really nice day, really sunny, so it was worthwhile doing.
