I recently went to south of France, it was about an hour south of Ajo with my wife and my daughter. We stayed in a holiday house which had a swimming pool which was the coldest swimming pool I've ever experienced. And, and we spent most of our time going to local villages when it wasn't too hot, when it was about 40 degrees, going to markets. I had a staph infection which I got treated by a French doctor who spoke no English and then had an allergic reaction to the drugs. But otherwise I had a very nice time, drinking lots of ros√© and eating lots of garlic, is what they produce apparently, that part of the world. And foie gras if you're morally compromised and you eat foie gras. And cheese obviously.
