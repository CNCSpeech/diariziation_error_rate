I have not been on many holidays recently. Okay. I went on holidays around this time last year to Scotland. I went with one of my best friends, Hannah. I drove up to hers in Yorkshire and then we drove in her mini up to Scotland. We went to several different places. We stayed near Inverness and visited lots of places around there. And then we travelled to Oban and then we got the ferry to the Isle of Mull and the Isle of Iona for a day. We did a lot of walking in the Highlands. We did some lovely walks and we tried to go dolphin watching but the dolphins didn't show themselves. We were all just sat on the beach trying to look for them but they didn't come. I had some very nice meals. We drove around a lot. We saw beautiful countryside and it was a really great holiday.
