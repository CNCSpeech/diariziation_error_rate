 What is your holiday trip like? Well it might be more of a trip than a holiday, but I think it's the closest to a holiday I've been on in a while. I went to the Peak District with my dad to go cycling. We rented e-bikes, we did the High Peak Trail, it's like a converted railway line. So it starts out nice and flat and easy, you've got sea fields and it's nice. So we went up that to the end and then came back on ourselves. And there's another path that I can't remember the name of, but it's another one that people on mountain bikes would do. It makes for a longer route, takes you down to a lake, you go around, all very nice. So we did that. There's a nice pub on the High Peak Trail, but we went too quickly. So by the time we got there we expected to be lunch, but it wasn't lunchtime. So we got a burger further up from a van. Which again was pleasant. Not very kind of wilderness, there's lots of little towns and villages, so where you want to stop for a tea or a coffee, easy.
