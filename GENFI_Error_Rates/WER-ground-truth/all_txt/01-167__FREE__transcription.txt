I'll talk about the holiday I've just been off, on because of lockdown's restrictions lifting, which is great because you know not being able to see my sister for four years has been hard.

The next few days we shopped, which was lovely just shopping with my sister and everything and she's such a good cook as well so we've had some lovely meals and then we went up to the panhandle because the daughter was getting married. So we stayed in a hotel, very nice, the Effie Hotel down up there, a very nice hotel and the next day we had a hen party and I went with them
