 So the most recent holiday I went on was to Barcelona. It was a last minute holiday and it was my daughter's first ever holiday because I've got a new baby daughter. She's 11 months old at the moment. At the time she was 9 months old. So it was a whole new experience for me and my partner taking a baby abroad. But all went to plan. Actually the most difficult part about the holiday was the packing of what to take for a baby and you need to take a hell of a lot of stuff. So we put it all in a suitcase and hoped for the best. When we got there we realised we'd forgot the baby milk so we hadn't got any powder or anything so I had to go to the local supermarket and they didn't have any. So we had to traipse around Barcelona for hours trying to find a big supermarket with the right brand of baby milk. So it was a fun start to the holiday. But the rest of the holiday was amazing and Ellie my daughter really enjoyed it. The reason why we went on a city break to somewhere like Barcelona is because she enjoys being around people, looking at people, sitting in restaurants and waving at people. So we had a really good time. We were only there 4 or 5 days and actually the main bit was would the flight be ok for a kid that age but I don't think she even realised she'd moved countries so she just sat there on our laps for the journey and enjoyed every second.
