I flew to Lyon in France where I got a train to Grenoble and was picked up by a friend and we then went on to this very small place in the northern Alps where a friend of mine has moved to and will become the doctor of the area. It was a trip with a group of school friends from a long time ago. It was really nice to see them. A lot of them have got children now so a lot of the activities were around the children but we did see the Mont Blanc and do l'Ouge d'été, like going down the slopes on one of the sled things which was really fun and paddle boarded in a lake in the mountains which was absolutely beautiful. I can't see how long it's left. That was minutes I think.
