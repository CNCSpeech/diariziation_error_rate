I went to Mexico for my bachelor party. It was nice weather. Went with some of my friends. Went swimming. Did a lot of drinking. Did a lot of eating. Tacos. Uh, went for five days. It was pretty hectic with COVID and testing, to come back. Um, yeah. It was too short. Could have gone on. Wish it was longer. Uh. Yeah. That's it.
