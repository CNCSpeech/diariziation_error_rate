 Okay. Our most recent holiday was to Lanzarote. My wife, actually, flew a week ahead of me. She went with some other family members and then I followed on. The weather was beautiful very warm and sunny when we were there. We enjoyed Lanzarote because of the weather, but also because there is good food there; lot of nice restaurants. We enjoyed going out to different places each evening and finding different kinds of food to eat. We went on a day trip to another part of the island where we travelled on a submarine, went out under the water for about an hour. It's an interesting island. There are volcanoes, there are caves, there are different kinds of landscapes from what we would normally see at home. The people are friendly.
