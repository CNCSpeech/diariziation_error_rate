 So I've just been on holiday to Mykonos and I went with my friend Jay which was lovely. It wasn't so hot there because we went at the beginning of May and so it was a bit windy but we were lucky that we had a really nice hotel and we had our own little terrace which was a bit of a sun trap so we got lots of sun. We had a beautiful hotel suite with a hot tub of our own on the balcony. It was really nice, we splashed out, treated ourselves after not being on holiday for two years. And what else did we do? We went out drinking most nights, probably getting a bit too old to be doing that but did it anyway. And yeah, it was really nice. I'd like to say it was chilled but I probably needed another holiday when I got back. It was very expensive there, I was really shocked at how expensive it is.
