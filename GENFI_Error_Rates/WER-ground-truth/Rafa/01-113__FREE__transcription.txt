 Okay, we went to France on the, on the train, on the Eurostar and we actually used Eurorail and travelled by train while we were in France, which was quite an adventure in some ways. So we, well obviously went into, well not obviously, maybe we went into Paris-Gardinau and then had to change stations and of course another train out to Troyes, I would call it, which is a lovely, beautiful medieval kind of town city with chocolate box buildings, very, all the old medieval things, lots of churches and the buildings higgledy-piggledy and sort of leaning over into the street, which is quite, erm, cute, cute I would say. And it was just really hot, the whole time, it was baking hot and we were just wandering about and sometimes just planning our route across the square by the little bits of shadow and stuff. And it was just, it was just lovely.
