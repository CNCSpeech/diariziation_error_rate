 Okay. Our most recent holiday was to Lanzarote. We went on a day trip to another part of the island where we travelled on a submarine, went out under the water for about an hour. It's an interesting island. There are volcanoes, there are caves, there are different kinds of landscapes from what we would normally see at home. The people are friendly.
