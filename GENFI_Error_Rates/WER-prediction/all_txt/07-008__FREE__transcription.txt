 So 2012 the n'back didn't come back to us, right? Ö andy, Ö and yasha,Ö Tony & Adrian Go outside, e so I started in Lisbon, stayed there for a few days, drove out to Cache Cache, a little beach town, stayed there and then drove up to Porto, stayed there for two days and then drove through Darrow Valley, the wine country, stayed there for a night, drank lots of wine and headed down to the Algarve and yeah, a nice beachy end to the trip. Still got a bit more time there.
