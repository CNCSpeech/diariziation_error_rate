 I think the most recent holiday that I can discuss is a trip that my family taken to visit my grandparents in Poland. My husband and two children came with me and we decided to spend two weeks in Poland meeting great-grandma, great-grandpa. We also had the pleasure of having my brother and sister join us and travel up to the northern Baltic Sea where we drank beer, played in the sand, held jellyfish, took the speed train and upon returning from that trip we got to see a live football game which was very exciting because they were playing English team and the energy in that team, in that game was very exciting. From then we traveled on to Ireland, saw the emerald green land, beautiful statues, fantastic beer, 18 euro for a Guinness which is crazy because they brew Guinness there and it was just an unbelievable experience.
