 Last summer I went to Crete for three weeks to visit some friends that had emigrated from the UK to then live in Crete. It was a really great trip. We like doing natural things, my husband and I, so we went for some walks in nature and ended up doing the longest gorge in Europe. It's on the gorge. And the rest of the trip we did five more gorge walks which was quite exciting and generally beautiful landscape, good food, good friends. It was just a really lovely trip. It was quite nice to be out there for such a long period of time as well. We visited some of the best beaches on Crete as well, including Palm Beach which was quite an interesting location. There was a river that meets the sea and it's at the mouth of the river, there's line of palm trees. It's quite an interesting, it doesn't feel like Europe, you feel like you're somewhere else which is really quite a unique experience. Yeah, I don't know what else to say.
