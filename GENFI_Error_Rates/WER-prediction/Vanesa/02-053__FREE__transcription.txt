 At the end of July, my husband and I flew from Gatwick to St Lucia, where we stayed at a place called East Winds, which has 30 cottages and is by the beach and also part of the rainforest. They have fantastic gardens and we had hummingbirds coming to our room with the feeder and we'd go down for breakfast about 8 o'clock in the morning. We'd go onto the beach and sit and read or paddle in the sea. We'd go in for lunch about 12.30. Sometimes they'd have a reggae band and we'd listen to music. And then we'd go back to the beach and sit and read again. And then in the evening we'd dress up and go to dinner and have champagne watching the sunset. And then that lasted 14 days and then we flew home.
