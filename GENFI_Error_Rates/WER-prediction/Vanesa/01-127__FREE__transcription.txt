 So the most recent long trip I went on was with my partner to see her family in Poland. It was freezing. I said we are never going back in the winter. It was at least minus 12, normally minus 20 degrees Celsius every day. We spent every day shoveling snow out of the way. Of course it was in a foreign country I knew not a word in the language of. I find it extraordinary my partner can speak fluent Polish and English. I don't know how she does it because all of her family only speak Polish. So it was challenging, not just the weather but the type of food that we had, which was not what I was normally comfortable eating. It was really strange food. Everyone was speaking Polish, which I don't know if you've looked but that's one of the hardest languages, well, if not the hardest, it's not like Spanish or German or the more
